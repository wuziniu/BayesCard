    An SPN built over a sub-schema.

    Application a) estimate cardinality for arbitrary acyclic sub-query using
    the equation Full_join_size*E(1/multiplier * 1_{c_1 Λ… Λc_n}).

    E.g. We have an SPN built over Customer, Orders and Orderline. What is the
    cardinality for customers joined with orders made in 2017?

    Application b) cardinality per tuple of next neighbour:
     Full_join_size*E(1/multiplier * 1_{c_1 Λ… Λc_n}) / next_neighbour_size
    This term is required if we merge an SPN into the current cardinality estimation.

    E.g. We have an SPN built over Customer and one over Orders and Orderline.
    What is the cardinality for Customers, Orders and Orderline joined with
    Orders.year = 2019?

    Assumption is that is built over acyclic graph for now.
